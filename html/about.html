          Goodbye to Language takes its name from Jean-Luc Godard's film and begins as a private vow:
          to push my world beyond the borders of words. This site is a small vessel for poems, photographs,
          diaries, and personal records, a place where fragments can drift, settle, and speak in their
          quiet tempo. It is not a manifesto or a museum, but a patient notebook, open to the accidental,
          the unfinished, and the tender weight of memory. Here I collect the traces of days, the light
          on walls, the pauses between scenes, and the small truths that refuse translation yet insist.

          <h2>
            Goodbye to Language
            
          </h2>
          <p>
            To borrow Godard's title is to admit that speech is never enough. I move through days with a
            surplus of feeling and image that language cannot carry. Photography, poems, and diary entries
            become another grammar, one that keeps the grain of time: dust on a window, a street after rain,
            the hush of a room at night. In this sense, Goodbye to Language is not an escape from language,
            but a widening of it, a listening for the other ways a life reveals itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will gather personal recordings of many kinds: short poems, long diaristic notes,
            sequences of photographs, letters to no one, and fragments that do not yet know what they are.
            Some posts will be dated like postcards; others will float without context. The archive will be
            tender and imperfect, a slow collection of attention rather than a finished story. I want it to
            feel like a desk with paper scattered across it, a place where thoughts can stay unfinished and
            still be true.
          </p>
          <p>
            If words are bridges, I keep walking along the water instead, tracing reflections and reeds.
            The work here is to keep company with what is small: a breath, a shadow, a sentence that breaks.
            By tending to fragments, I hope to expand my personal world and offer a quiet place for yours
            to rest beside it.
          </p>
